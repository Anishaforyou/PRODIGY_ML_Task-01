# 🏠 House Price Prediction Web App

This is a simple and interactive machine learning web application that predicts the **price of a house** based on:

- 📏 Square Footage  
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms  
- 🛁 Number of Bathrooms

The prediction is powered by a trained **Random Forest Regression model**, and the web app is built using **Flask** (Python), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
